      <p>I am the technical expert in the group. My job is to create a time management tool for our group. In order to do this, Javascript will be used. The reason why JavaScript will be used is because JavaScript focuses on the functionality of the website. This means that when JavaScript is incorporated in code, an output will be produced. In addition to me creating a time management tool, I will also help the developers fix bugs or errors within the code. I will also work with the designer, in order to make a cover page for our project.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I developed a Chess Computer as part of my Computer Science project at A-Level. This allowed the user to change the difficulty of the computer and ask the computer for hints in order to get better at playing Chess. I also have experience with the Lua programming language which has helped me in game design. I have entered numerous coding competitions on websites such as HackerRank and CodeChef, which has enabled me to get better at my coding skills.<br>
        <p>My interest in Computer Science stemmed from playing video games such as ROBLOX, where I was introduced to the Lua programming language. As well as playing video games, reading books such as Alan Turing's Vision have furthered my interest in Computer Science.</p>
