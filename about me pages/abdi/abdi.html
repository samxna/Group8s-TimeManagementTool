      <h1>My role</h1>
      <p>As a developer, my main goal is to make the designers' ideas come to life. This involves working closely with them to understand their vision and translating it into functional code. Strong communication skills and the ability to problem-solve and find creative solutions are essential in this process. It is important to keep in mind that the end goal is to create a user experience that is seamless and intuitive for the end user. That is why it is so important to work collaboratively with the designers and leverage each other's expertise. By doing this, we can successfully bring their ideas to life and create a successful website.</p>
