    <h3>What Is Needed From A Leader</h3>
    <p>
      As leader I make it my mission to be there and support my team in anyway needed,
      I do this by managing times and delegating work to everyone to insure that they
      all have jobs and are paired with those who make the task finsished with maximum
      effectiveness. I also act as the communicator to present my teams ideas and represent their
      plans, I also format ideas to my group to help them further develop thier concepts for a project.

    <h3>My Experiences To Become A Leader</h3>
    <p>
      In my past I have had alot of leadership experience aswell as alot of times where I was given
      the task of communicating and cooridanating people to either more efficeintly complete a goal
      or greater the outcome of said goal. examples of these times are like when I was a student prefect
      in my 6th form and I lead the counsilers for each tutor group to find a way to organise a prom.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="text2">
    <p>
      I am a student at London City Univercity and I am currently studying computer science. I have always
      had a strong passion towards the technological. This passion is most noticeable when I was younger
      as I tended to be infatuated with the componts and their funtions which led to the creation of the laptop.
      I started to delve into my passion by picking computer science in GCSE, this allowed me to become better at
      python programming and deepen my understanding of computer architecture.
