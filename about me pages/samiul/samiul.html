         As one of the developer(s) I have the responsibility of bringing the Designer's ideas into fruition alongside another developer and for more advanced areas with 
         the help of our Technical Expert. My main focus will be on creating the concepts that we agreed upon as a group into a functioning website using both HTML and 
         CSS to style the page(s) according to our wishes.

        <p>
         I am currently a student at City, University of London at Stage 0 (Foundation Year), during my time at City I have made much more progress on both HTML and CSS
        allowing me to become very comfortable with creating websites that fit my needs or function the way I need them to. Previously, I only had experience with python
        where I rarely experimented outside of the curriculum (in GCSE / A-Level Computer Science).
        <br><br>
        For my A-Level Project however, I experimented with Unity where I first encountered C# and had to quickly learn its syntax, significantly different environment and IDE.
         Going from the python IDLE to Unity was a major change that took some time to get used to but I was able to adapt and overcome this with my final project being a far more
         advanced result than I expected.
